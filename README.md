# Portfolio with Starship Game Project Showcase

## Description

I had an idea of a more interactive scene happing in the background as you navigate a page/application in a very traditional way, like simple clicks/taps on the screen.  It was quite the learning experience to get all the elemets working together, and I found ways to achieve this vision into my portfolio.

This portfolio has an interactive spaceship game where you can navigate and shoot by just clicking/tapping.
For users that have less interest in this specific interactivity, I have also made a more traditional portfolio if they scroll down or jump to specific sections hightlighted in the top navigation bar.

## Usage

To play the Interactive Space portion of the portfolio, just click/tap in space to navigate the spaceship and shoot the objects.  Three Special objects will showcase top projects. Scroll down the page for a more traditional portfolio experience.  Projects have links to their codebase and live builds in the top right of their respective windows.
