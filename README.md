# Portfolio with Starship Game Project Showcase

## Description

I love real-time interactive software, space themes, and 3D visuals.  After a few attempts, I decided incorporated them all into my portfolio.
This interactive portfolio has a fun starship game where you can navigate through space by clicking/tapping to move and shoot.
For users that have less interest in the specific interactivity, I have also made it a more traditional portfolio if they scroll down or jump to specific sections.

To play the Interactive Space portion of the Portfolio, just click/tap in space to navigate the starship and shoot the objects.  Special objects will showcase top projects. Scroll down the page for a more traditional Portfolio experience.
